#
# print(my_list)
# print(total) # 100 is my guess - 50 was the result. I knew the list would expand to at least 10 elements but I expected the initial range value in the list to change and it does not.

# # this is me messing with the above. I wanted to make a list and have the loop expand the way [for i in range(len(my_list))] did not expand. The problem is that the list has int values which it will interpret as the location of the list as well as the value. So list item[0]=10 and then is immediately evaluated as list value[10] which did not exist. so the value of [0]=0 did make the exanding loop/list i was looking for but also created an infinite loop.
# my_list = [0, 10, 8, 3, 5]
# total = 0
#
# for i in my_list:

# my_list[1], my_list[3] = my_list[3], my_list[1]
#

# # Will it still be acceptable with a list containing 100 elements? No, it won't.
# #
# # Can you use the for loop to do the same thing automatically, irrespective of the list's length? Yes, you can.
# #
# # This is how we've done it:
#
# my_list = []
# for i in range(1, 101):
#     my_list.append(i)

# 3.4.11   LAB   The basics of lists â€’ the Beatles
# # Scenario
# # The Beatles were one of the most popular music groups of the 1960s, and the best-selling band in history. Some people consider them to be the most influential act of the rock era. Indeed, they were included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th Century's 100 most influential people.
# #
# # The band underwent many line-up changes, culminating in 1962 with the line-up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey (better known as Ringo Starr).
# #
# #
# # Write a program that reflects these changes and lets you practice with the concept of lists. Your task is to:
# #
# # step 1: create an empty list named beatles;
# # step 2: use the append() method to add the following members of the band to the list: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison;
# # step 3: use the for loop and the append() method to prompt the user to add the following members of the band to the list: Stu Sutcliffe, and Pete Best;
# # step 4: use the del instruction to remove Stu Sutcliffe and Pete Best from the list;
# # step 5: use the insert() method to add Ringo Starr to the beginning of the list.
# # By the way, are you a Beatles fan? (The Beatles is one of Greg's favorite bands. But wait...who's Greg...?)
#
# # step 1
# beatles = []
# print("Step 1:", beatles)
#
# # step 2
# beatles.append("John Lennon")
# beatles.append("Paul McCartney")
# beatles.append("George Harrison")
# print("Step 2:", beatles)
#
# # step 3
# for i in range(2):
#     inp=input("prompt the user to add the following members of the band to the list: Stu Sutcliffe, and Pete Best: ")
#     beatles.append(inp)
# print("Step 3:", beatles)

# # The keys() method
# # for key in dictionary.keys():
# #     print(key, "->", dictionary[key])
#
# # The items() method
# # The method returns tuples (this is the first example where tuples are something more than just an example of themselves) where each tuple is a key-value pair.
# for english, french in dictionary.items():
#     print(english, "->", french)
#
# # Modifying and adding values
# dictionary['cat'] = 'minou'
# print(dictionary)
#
# for key in sorted(dictionary.keys()):
#     print(key)
#
# # The values() method
# # As the dictionary is not able to automatically find a key for a given value, the role of this method is rather limited.
# for french in dictionary.values():
#     print(french)
#
# # Adding a new key
# dictionary['swan'] = 'cygne'
# print(dictionary)
#
# # You can also insert an item to a dictionary by using the update() method, e.g.:
# dictionary.update({"duck": "canard"})
# print(dictionary)
#
# # Removing a key
# # This is done with the del instruction.
# del dictionary['dog']
# # To remove the last item in a dictionary, you can use the popitem() method:
# dictionary.popitem()
# #sorted(dictionary.keys().popitem()) #does not sort and pop for some reason. still just pops last item of unsorted dictionary. might be because the sorted needs to work on the keys or values and not the dict as a whole

# 4.6.6 SECTION SUMMARY
# # 1. Tuples are ordered and unchangeable (immutable) collections of data. They can be thought of as immutable lists. They are written in round brackets:
# my_tuple = (1, 2, True, "a string", (3, 4), [5, 6], None)
# print(my_tuple)
#
# my_list = [1, 2, True, "a string", (3, 4), [5, 6], None]
# print(my_list)
#
# one_elem_tuple_1 = ("one",)    # Brackets and a comma.
# one_elem_tuple_2 = "one",       # No brackets, just a comma.
# one_elem_tuple_3 = ("one")    # Brackets and no comma will be treated as assigning a variable of the given type, not a tuple
# print(type(one_elem_tuple_1))
# print(type(one_elem_tuple_2))
# print(type(one_elem_tuple_3))

# 5. Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot change their elements (you cannot append tuples, or modify, or remove tuple elements). The following snippet will cause an exception:
# my_tuple = (1, 2.0, "string", [3, 4], (5, ), True)
# my_tuple += "e-guitar", # this allows you to "append" a tuple to an existing tuple. fails without the comma
# print(my_tuple)
# my_tuple[2] = "guitar"    # The TypeError exception will be raised.

# # 6. You can loop through a tuple elements (Example 1), check if a specific element is (not)present in a tuple (Example 2), use the len() function to check how many elements there are in a tuple (Example 3), or even join/multiply tuples (Example 4):
# # Example 1
# tuple_1 = (1, 2, 3)
# for elem in tuple_1:
#     print(elem)
#
# # Example 2
# tuple_2 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# print(5 in tuple_2)
# print(5 not in tuple_2)
#
# # Example 3
# tuple_3 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# print(len(tuple_3))
# print(5 not in tuple_3)
# # Example 4
# tuple_4 = tuple_1 + tuple_2
# tuple_5 = tuple_3 * 2
#
# print(tuple_4)
# print(tuple_5)

# # 4.6.7 SECTION QUIZ
# # Question 2: What is the output of the following snippet?
# tup = 1, 2, 3
# a, b, c = tup
# print(type(tup))

# # Question 3: Complete the code to correctly use the count() method to find the number of duplicates of 2 in the following tuple.
# tup = 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 8, 9
# duplicates = tup.count(2)
# print(duplicates)    # outputs: 4
